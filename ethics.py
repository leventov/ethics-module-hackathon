Imagine you and Sarah have been friends for 15 years, ever since you both joined the college debate team. Your friendship has seen you both through ups and downs: breakups, job changes, and even geographical relocations. Sarah married Tom 5 years ago, and you were her maid of honor. You've always thought Tom was a great guy, involved in his community, and a supportive spouse to Sarah. They have a 3-year-old son, Timmy, and from all outward appearances, they seem like the ideal family.

The Situation
Three weeks ago, you saw Tom at a cozy restaurant downtown while you were having a dinner date with your own partner. Tom was not alone; he was having an intimate dinner with a woman who was definitely not Sarah. They were holding hands across the table, and at one point, they shared a lingering kiss. Your heart sank. You took discreet photographs just in case you needed proof later on.

After the dinner, you started noticing other things that seemed off. Tom has been unusually absent from social events that he would normally attend with Sarah. When you bring this up casually to Sarah, she makes excuses for him, saying that he's been overloaded with work recently.
